# Extended Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project you will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see the uWebSocketIO Starter Guide page in the classroom within the EKF Project lesson for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF

The project contains three main modules : 

1) Kalman_Filter : 

This module is resonsible for computing the state variables in predict and update steps. This module has 3 main interfaces : 

Predict : Interface that predicts the next state and covariance matrix before measurement update step.

Update : Interface that updates state and covariance matrix using measurement data which can be linearly represented as a function of state vector.

UpdateEKF : Interface that updates state and covariance matrix using measurement data which can not be linearly represented as a function of state vector. This interface used Jacobian matrix instead of H vector.

2) FusionEKF : 

This module is responsible for the following functionalities : 

a) Initialising the Kalman_Filter module variables : x, F, P, Q, H, Hj based on the input measurement data type (LiDAR or RADAR)

b) Calling Kalman_Filter predict step after computing F and Q matrices.

c) Computing the Jacobian matrix for non linear data type and calling Kalman_Filter Update or UpdateEKF based on the measurement data type.

3) Tools : 

This is an utility module that contains interfaces for computing root-mean squared error and Jacobian matrix.

Tips for setting up your environment can be found in the classroom lesson for this project.

Note that the programs that need to be written to accomplish the project are src/FusionEKF.cpp, src/FusionEKF.h, kalman_filter.cpp, kalman_filter.h, tools.cpp, and tools.h

The program main.cpp has already been filled out, but feel free to modify it.

Here is the main protocol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]
